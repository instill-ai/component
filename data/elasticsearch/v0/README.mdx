The Elasticsearch component is a data component that allows users to access the Elasticsearch database.
It can carry out the following tasks:

- [Search](#search)
- [Vector Search](#vector-search)
- [Index](#index)
- [Update](#update)
- [Delete](#delete)
- [Create Index](#create-index)
- [Delete Index](#delete-index)



## Release Stage

`Alpha`



## Configuration

The component configuration is defined and maintained [here](https://github.com/instill-ai/component/blob/main/application/elasticsearch/v0/config/definition.json).




## Setup


| Field | Field ID | Type | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Cloud ID (required) | `cloud-id` | string | Fill in the Cloud ID for the Elasticsearch instance |
