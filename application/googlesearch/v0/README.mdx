The Google Search component is an application component that allows users to leverage the Google Search engine.
It can carry out the following tasks:

- [Search](#search)



## Release Stage

`Alpha`



## Configuration

The component configuration is defined and maintained [here](https://github.com/instill-ai/component/blob/main/application/googlesearch/v0/config/definition.json).




## Setup




In order to communicate with Google, the following connection details need to be
provided. You may specify them directly in a pipeline recipe as key-value pairs
withing the component's `setup` block, or you can create a **Connection** from
the [**Integration Settings**](https://www.instill.tech/docs/vdp/integration)
page and reference the whole `setup` as `setup:
${connection.<my-connection-id>}`.

| Field | Field ID | Type | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| API Key (required) | `api-key` | string | API Key for the Google Custom Search API. You can create one <a href="https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/overview#api-key">here</a> |
| Search Engine ID (required) | `cse-id` | string | ID of the Search Engine to use. Before using the Custom Search JSON API you will first need to create and configure your Programmable Search Engine. If you have not already created a Programmable Search Engine, you can start by visiting [the Programmable Search Engine control panel](https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/controlpanel/all). <br /> You can find this in the URL of your Search Engine. For example, if the URL of your search engine is `https://cse.google.com/cse.js?cx=012345678910`, the ID value is: `012345678910` |
