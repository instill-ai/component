### Chunking Strategy
There are three strategies available for chunking text in Text Component:
- 1. Token
- 2. Recursive
- 3. Markdown

#### Token
Language models have a token limit. You should not exceed the token limit. When you split your text into chunks it is therefore a good idea to count the number of tokens. There are many tokenizers. When you count tokens in your text you should use the same tokenizer as used in the language model.

|----------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `chunk-size`         | integer          | Specifies the maximum size of each chunk in terms of the number of tokens                                                                                                                                    |
| `chunk-overlap`      | integer          | Determines the number of tokens that overlap between consecutive chunks                                                                                                                                      |

| `show-token-count`   | boolean          | When it is set to True, the number of tokens in each chunk is included in the resulting split text. When it is set to False, the number of tokens in each chunk is not included in the resulting split text. |

#### Recursive
This text splitter is the recommended one for generic text. It is parameterized by a list of characters. It tries to split on them in order until the chunks are small enough. The default list is ["\n\n", "\n", " ", ""]. This has the effect of trying to keep all paragraphs (and then sentences, and then words) together as long as possible, as those would generically seem to be the strongest semantically related pieces of text.
