The Slack component is a application connector that allows users to get and send message on Slack.
It can carry out the following tasks:

- [Read Message](#read-message)
- [Send Message](#send-message)

## Release Stage

`Alpha`

## Configuration

The component configuration is defined and maintained [here](https://github.com/instill-ai/component/blob/main/pkg/connector/slack/v0/config/definition.json).

## Connection

| Field | Field ID | Type | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| token (required) | `token` | string | 1. Go to [Slack API](https://api.slack.com/apps) and create a new app. 2. After creating a new app, go to the OAuth & Permissions page by clicking the app name. 3. Set the scope for the App.   - For reading messages, you need to set the scope to `channels:history` and `channels:read`.   - For sending messages, you need to set the scope to `chat:write`. 4. After setting the scope of App, you need to do 'Reinstall to Workspace'. 5. Go to the OAuth & Permissions page and copy the token.   - You will have 2 tokens, one for Bot User OAuth Token and another for User OAuth Token. You can use either of them.     - If you want to send a message to a channel by a bot, you should use Bot User OAuth Token, which is the token with the prefix of `xoxb-`.     - If you want to send a message to a channel by a user, you should use User OAuth Token, which is the token with the prefix of `xoxp-`.     - If you use Bot User OAuth Token, you need to invite the bot to the channel you want to read a message. |
