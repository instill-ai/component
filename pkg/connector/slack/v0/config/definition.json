Set the scope for the App.   - For reading messages, you need to set the scope to `channels:history` and `channels:read`.   - For sending messages, you need to set the scope to `chat:write`. 4. After setting the scope of App, you need to do 'Reinstall to Workspace'. 5. Go to the OAuth & Permissions page and copy the token.   - You will have 2 tokens, one for Bot User OAuth Token and another for User OAuth Token. You can use either of them.     - If you want to send a message to a channel by a bot, you should use Bot User OAuth Token, which is the token with the prefix of `xoxb-`.     - If you want to send a message to a channel by a user, you should use User OAuth Token, which is the token with the prefix of `xoxp-`.     - If you use Bot User OAuth Token, you need to invite the bot to the channel you want to read a message.",
