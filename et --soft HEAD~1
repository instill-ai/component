    fix: change md format to html tag for correct frontend link (#240)
    
    Because
    
    - Most frontend links are broken now, and some text is out of box.
    - Change to HTML <a> tag can render a proper hyperlink
    
    This commit
    
    - Change markdown format link in .json file to HTML <a> tag
    
    ### Important Note:
    Most links that refer to our own documentation are dead. Maybe we should
    merge this PR after fixing it.

    feat(document): add docx doc pptx ppt html to transform to text in markdown format (#232)
    
    Because
    
    - we want to handle more types of unstructured data
    
    This commit
    
    - add the transformer for docx doc pptx ppt html to markdown
    
    In high level, we do
    - judge what file extensions
      - If it is pdf, directly use pdfplumber to convert pdf to markdown
    - If it is docx / doc / ppt / pptx, transform the document to pdf by
    libreoffice, convert pdf to markdown with pdfplumber.
    - If it is html, transform it to markdown with html-to-markdown package
    
    The reason we separate docx/doc & ppt/pptx is they are essentially
    different for users according to use cases.
    It will differentiate the pdf to markdown logic. So, we divide them
    first.

    feat: add handler to auto-fill missing default values (#210)
    
    Because:
    - Request from frontend and direct API calls may miss some optional
    fields
    - The underlying meaning of default is that if no value is provided, we
    will use this value instead.
    
    This commit
    
    - Implement a function in the `base` package for all components to use
    - The function supports filling fields with primitive types, including
    string, integer, number, boolean, and array of them.
    - Support allOf, anyOf, oneOf fields
    - Recursively fill in multi-layer object value
