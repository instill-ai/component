It can carry out the following tasks:

- [Text Generation Chat](#text-generation-chat)



## Release Stage

`Alpha`



## Configuration

The component configuration is defined and maintained [here](https://github.com/instill-ai/component/blob/main/ai/groq/v0/config/definition.json).




## Setup


| Field | Field ID | Type | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| API Key | `api-key` | string | Fill in your GroqCloud API key. To find your keys, visit the GroqCloud API Keys page. |




## Supported Tasks

### Text Generation Chat

Provide text outputs in response to text inputs.


| Input | ID | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Task ID (required) | `task` | string | `TASK_TEXT_GENERATION_CHAT` |
| Model (required) | `model` | string | The OSS model to be used |
| Prompt (required) | `prompt` | string | The prompt text |
| System message | `system-message` | string | The system message helps set the behavior of the assistant. For example, you can modify the personality of the assistant or provide specific instructions about how it should behave throughout the conversation. By default, the modelâ€™s behavior is set using a generic message as "You are a helpful assistant." |
| Prompt Images | `prompt-images` | array[string] | The prompt images (Note: Only a subset of OSS models support image inputs) |
| Chat history | `chat-history` | array[object] | Incorporate external chat history, specifically previous messages within the conversation.

| Seed | `seed` | integer | The seed |
| Temperature | `temperature` | number | The temperature for sampling |
| Top K | `top-k` | integer | Integer to define the top tokens considered within the sample operation to create new text |
| Max new tokens | `max-new-tokens` | integer | The maximum number of tokens for model to generate |
| Top P | `top-p` | number | Float to define the tokens that are within the sample operation of text generation. Add tokens in the sample for more probable to least probable until the sum of the probabilities is greater than top-p (default=0.5) |
| User | `user` | string | The user name passed to GroqPlatform |



| Output | ID | Type | Description |
